# Geoprocessing with ArcGIS Pro

## **Introduction**

This workshop introduces geoprocessing tools and procedures in ArcGIS Pro. It accompanies the Introduction to ArcGIS Pro workshop in which you learned how to add, symbolize, and interact with GIS data and export a map from ArcGIS Pro. If you are unfamiliar with ArcGIS Pro, please complete the Introduction to ArcGIS Pro workshop first. In this workshop, we will use geoprocessing and spatial analysis to explore and understand data.
